Data Structures and Algorithms Notes

** How to convert problem definitions to programs

** what to do at choice points (where to divide if we r applying divide and conqour technique)

**detailed complexity analysis of the initial definition.(at what choice point algorithm will be efficient)

**design of final algorithm

**design of data structure

**implementation of final program.
